# Lightweight-Data-Anonymization-Engine-Using-Laplace-Noise-and-String-Masking

Below I have a small custom dataset of the people that work in an organisation.

Age is anonymised using laplace noise, this is done to mask the true values making it difficult to identify individuals

Categorical values are hidden by replacing them with "*surpressed*"

After running the anonymisation tool, we can see Name, Gender and Occupation are all anonymised by "*surpressed*" written instead
and the Age, integer number, is made a continous number.
